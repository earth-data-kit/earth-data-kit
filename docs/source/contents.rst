Earth Data Kit
=============================

Today, the GIS world is filled with many great tools and technologies. Each tool is specialized â€” some offer powerful mapping features, while others excel at data visualization. 

However, when you try to build a complete end-to-end data pipeline, the process becomes challenging, time-consuming and costly. This common struggle inspired us to create Earth Data Kit. 

EDK is designed to bridge these gaps, helping you connect various parts of the GIS process with ease. With Earth Data Kit, data scientists can focus on analyzing data and drawing insights instead of wrestling with complex data processes and engineering challenges.

Check out our :ref:`Roadmap <roadmap>` to see what we're working on and what is planned.

Check out the :ref:`Getting Started` to learn how to install and use Earth Data Kit.
